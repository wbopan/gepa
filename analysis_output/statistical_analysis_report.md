# Statistical Analysis of GEPA Run Results

## Summary

This analysis examines whether observed Pareto frontier ratio differences
between methods (adaboost, bayesian, baseline) are statistically significant
or due to random variation.

## Data Overview

| Method | Candidates | Val Samples | Original Frontier Ratio |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| adaboost | 37 | 30 | 24.3% |
| bayesian | 30 | 30 | 76.7% |
| baseline | 38 | 30 | 34.2% |

## 1. Bootstrap Analysis of Frontier Ratios

Bootstrap resampling (n=1000) on validation samples to estimate confidence intervals.

| Method | Mean | 95% CI Lower | 95% CI Upper |
|--------|------|--------------|--------------|
| adaboost | 16.3% | 5.4% | 29.7% |
| bayesian | 38.3% | 10.0% | 66.7% |
| baseline | 18.3% | 2.6% | 34.2% |

**CI Overlap (adaboost vs bayesian):** Yes
**CI Overlap (bayesian vs baseline):** Yes

## 2. Permutation Tests

Testing H0: Method labels don't affect frontier ratio (n=10000 permutations).

| Comparison | Observed Diff | p-value | Significant (α=0.05)? |
|------------|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| adaboost_vs_baseline | -9.9% | 0.9578 | No |
| bayesian_vs_baseline | +42.5% | 0.0100 | Yes |
| adaboost_vs_bayesian | -52.3% | 0.0713 | No |

## 3. Candidate Quality Analysis

Mean score per candidate (average across all validation samples).

| Method | Mean | Std | Median | Min | Max |
|--------|------|-----|--------|-----|-----|
| adaboost | 0.623 | 0.137 | 0.667 | 0.133 | 0.800 |
| bayesian | 0.554 | 0.103 | 0.567 | 0.333 | 0.767 |
| baseline | 0.510 | 0.178 | 0.550 | 0.033 | 0.767 |

### Pairwise Statistical Tests

| Comparison | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Effect Size | KS Stat | KS p-value |
|------------|----------------|---------|-------------|---------|------------|
| adaboost_vs_bayesian | 813.5 | 0.0011 | -0.466 | 0.457 | 0.0012 |
| adaboost_vs_baseline | 1010.5 | 0.0011 | -0.437 | 0.415 | 0.0019 |
| bayesian_vs_baseline | 619.5 | 0.5435 | -0.087 | 0.216 | 0.3531 |

## 4. Per-Sample Comparison

Sample wins (which method has highest success rate on each sample):

- **adaboost**: 18.0 samples
- **bayesian**: 8.0 samples
- **baseline**: 4.0 samples

### Pairwise Sample-Level Comparisons

- **adaboost_vs_bayesian**: adaboost wins on 20 samples, bayesian wins on 9, ties: 1
- **adaboost_vs_baseline**: adaboost wins on 25 samples, baseline wins on 4, ties: 1
- **bayesian_vs_baseline**: bayesian wins on 21 samples, baseline wins on 9, ties: 0

## 5. Domination Structure

Analysis of how candidates dominate each other within each method.

| Method | Gini Coef | Max Dominator Ratio | Mean Dominates | Max Dominates |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|----|
| adaboost | 0.628 | 77.8% | 2.7 | 28 |
| bayesian | 0.885 | 24.1% | 0.4 | 7 |
| baseline | 0.554 | 43.2% | 2.7 | 16 |

## Conclusions

1. **Bayesian vs Baseline**: The difference in frontier ratio is statistically significant (p=0.0100). Bayesian method produces significantly more frontier candidates.
2. **Adaboost vs Baseline**: The difference is NOT statistically significant (p=0.9578).
3. **Adaboost vs Bayesian**: The difference is NOT statistically significant (p=0.0713).

### Overall Assessment

**1 of 3 pairwise comparisons show significant differences.** Some methods appear to differ, but not all comparisons reach significance.
